            <p>  The project is based on MERN, a technology stack that utilizes MongoDB document database, the Express.js web framework, React.js client-side framework, and the Node.js server framework.

               <br/> <br/>   The front-end client side utilizes API calls that communicate with the server, which contains the API routes, data models, and controllers that retrieve information from the database.

               <br/> <br/>  This project was meant as a proof of concept for a streamlined PC-build planning application. It’s meant to make the PC build planning experience less difficult, intimidating, and time consuming for both new and experienced PC builders.</p>
